## How to Import Your Script and Break It Down into Scenes and Elements
  
The first step in using Movie Magic Scheduling is to import your script into the software. You can import your script from various formats, such as Final Draft, PDF, or plain text. Once you import your script, Movie Magic Scheduling will automatically break it down into scenes and assign scene numbers.
  
The next step is to break down each scene into elements, such as characters, locations, props, wardrobe, makeup, special effects, etc. You can do this manually by selecting each element from a list of categories and typing its name, or you can use the Auto Breakdown feature that will scan your script and identify the elements based on keywords.
  
Breaking down your script into elements will help you organize your production and estimate your resources and costs. You can also add additional information to each element, such as day/night, interior/exterior, cast size, page count, etc.
  
## How to Create a Digital Stripboard and Rearrange Your Scenes According to Various Criteria
  
After you break down your script into scenes and elements, you can create a digital stripboard that will display your scenes as colored strips on a board. The stripboard is a visual representation of your shooting schedule that allows you to rearrange your scenes according to various criteria.
  
You can drag and drop your strips on the board to change their order or group them into days or weeks. You can also sort your strips by different categories, such as location, time of day, cast availability, etc. You can also filter your strips by specific elements or keywords to find them easily.
  
Creating a digital stripboard will help you optimize your shooting schedule and reduce your production costs. You can also compare different scenarios and see how they affect your schedule and budget.
  
## How to Set Reminders and Flags for Potential Conflicts and Issues
  
One of the new features of Movie Magic Scheduling 3.6 3.7 is the ability to set reminders and flags for potential conflicts and issues that may arise during your production. For example, you can set a reminder for when an actor's contract expires or when a location permit expires. You can also set a flag for when two elements have a conflict, such as when two actors are scheduled to be in different locations at the same time.
  
Setting reminders and flags will help you avoid scheduling disasters and ensure that your production runs smoothly. You can also customize the colors and icons of your reminders and flags to make them more visible on your stripboard.
  
## How to Attach Images and Notes to Your Breakdown Sheets
  
Another new feature of Movie Magic Scheduling 3.6 3.7 is the ability to attach images and notes to your breakdown sheets. For example, you can attach storyboards, location photos, actor headshots, or any other relevant images to your breakdown sheets. You can also add notes or comments to your breakdown sheets to communicate with your crew or keep track of changes.
